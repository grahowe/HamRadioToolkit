# HamRadioToolkit
A little toolkit with a two element dipole calculator, balun calculator, and a UTC time checker.

I made this in my free time just as proof of concept. I needed an easy access tool that could calculate a dipole length for me. For added convenience, I've also added a balun calculator and a UTC time checker. This will help you create a balun or check the UTC timestamp for your logbook.
This is a basic Python script, so you should be able to modify it easily. Feel free to!

73s and happy operating!
